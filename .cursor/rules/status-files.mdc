      # STATUS.md File Guidelines
      
      ## File Structure
      Each STATUS.md should include:
      
      1. Current Progress
         - Core implementation status
         - Key features completed
         - Performance benchmarks
         - Recent changes
      
      2. Next Steps
         - Planned improvements
         - Known issues to address
         - Feature roadmap
         - Performance targets
      
      3. Technical Details
         - Dependencies
         - Usage examples
         - Known limitations
         - Questions to resolve
      
      4. Bot Notes
         - AI assistant's observations
         - Context for future sessions
         - Implementation decisions
         - Areas needing attention
         - Debugging history
      
      ## File Locations
      
      1. Root STATUS.md (Required)
         - Overall project status
         - High-level roadmap
         - Cross-cutting concerns
         - Major milestones
      
      2. Component STATUS.md
         - Only in actively developed components
         - Component-specific details
         - Local implementation status
         - Remove when development is complete
      
      ## Maintenance Rules
      
      1. File Creation
         - Create when starting work in a new directory
         - Include initial status and goals
         - Link to related components
      
      2. Updates
         - Update after significant changes
         - Record performance metrics
         - Document design decisions
         - Note breaking changes
      
      3. Cleanup
         - Remove component STATUS.md when work is complete
         - Transfer relevant info to root STATUS.md
         - Keep historical context in git history
      
      4. Session Start
         - Review relevant STATUS.md files
         - Check for recent changes
         - Note any blockers or dependencies
