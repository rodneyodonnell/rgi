      Before committing changes, you must:

      1. Run relevant tests for modified files:
         ```bash
         # For specific test files
         python -m pytest path/to/test_file.py -v
         
         # For all tests in a module
         python -m pytest path/to/module/tests/ -v
         ```

      2. Run linting checks:
         ```bash
         # For specific files
         python -m pylint path/to/file.py
         
         # For all Python files in a directory
         python -m pylint path/to/directory/
         ```

      3. Fix any test failures or linting issues before committing.

      4. Include test and lint results in the commit message if significant changes were made.

      Tips for efficient testing and linting:

      1. Only run tests relevant to your changes
      2. Use pytest's -v flag for more detailed output
      3. Use pytest's -k flag to run specific test cases
      4. Fix linting issues as you go rather than all at once

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Direct commit without checks
      git commit -m "Update function"

      # Good: Run tests and lint first
      python -m pytest rgi/tests/players/alphazero/test_tf_model_integration.py -v
      python -m pylint rgi/players/alphazero/ray_rl.py
      git commit -m "Fix TensorFlow model type hints - tests pass, lint clean"
    output: "Properly checked commit with specific test and lint commands"

  - input: |
      # Bad: Commit with failing tests
      python -m pytest rgi/tests/players/alphazero/test_tf_model_integration.py
      # Test fails
      git commit -m "Update model"

      # Good: Fix tests first, then commit
      # Fix the code...
      python -m pytest rgi/tests/players/alphazero/test_tf_model_integration.py
      # Tests pass
      git commit -m "Update model - fixed test failures in TF model integration"
    output: "Commit after fixing test failures"
