## Performance Benchmarks

### Archive Performance
- Memory-mapped archive significantly outperforms single-file for small operations
- Connect4 (100 games, 100 states):
  - Memory-mapped: ~55.7ms
  - Single-file: ~129.2ms
- Count21 (100 games, 100 states):
  - Memory-mapped: ~43.8ms
  - Single-file: ~103.0ms

### AlphaZero Performance
- Self-play generation: ~1.1 games/second
- Random player baseline: ~26 games/second
- GPU utilization needs investigation (currently low)

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Complete AlphaZero Implementation
   - Store MCTS policy counts in trajectories
   - Make implementation more generic for other games
   - Profile and optimize performance
   - Investigate low GPU utilization
   - Resume training after reboot
   - Analyze training metrics and tune hyperparameters

2. Code Organization
   - Auto-register games
   - Add JAX/Torch/NumPy embeddings
   - Split embedders into framework-specific files
   - Improve test fixtures organization

### Medium Priority
1. Game Expansion
   - Support for 3+ players
   - Non-board games
   - Non-sequential turn games
   - More complex games (e.g., Power Grid)

2. ML Algorithm Implementation
   - Complete ZeroZero implementation
   - Plan MuZero implementation
   - Consider EfficientZero optimizations

### Long Term Goals
1. Novel Game AI Development
   - Iterate on existing algorithms
   - Develop hybrid approaches
   - Experiment with LLM integration

2. Infrastructure Improvements
   - Expand GPU support
   - Optimize Docker setup
   - Enhance web app functionality
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Set up proper bug tracking system

## Weekly Tasks
| Task | Last Done | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Update dependencies | 2024-02-09 | ‚úÖ |
| Full lint cleanup | 2024-03-27 | ‚úÖ |
| Complete test run | 2024-02-03 | ‚ùå |
| Rebuild Docker image | 2024-02-09 | ‚úÖ |

## Known Issues
1. GPU utilization is lower than expected
2. Docker storage location needs optimization
3. Test fixtures could be more efficient
4. Web app needs favicon
5. File write verification issues with cursor rules - sometimes files appear empty after writing

## Dependencies
- Python 3.12+
- TensorFlow
- JAX
- Ray
- NumPy
- Docker
- TypeScript (web app)

## Hardware Requirements
Current development targets:
- GPU: 8GB RTX 2070 Super
- RAM: 64GB
- Future plans may include cloud GPU resources

## Bot Notes
- Consider caching expanded nodes in AlphaZero MCTS
- Archive class might benefit from ArchiveBuilder pattern
- Power Grid implementation could be split into mini-games
- Web app TypeScript compilation needs automation
