# AlphaZero Implementation Status

## Current Progress

### Core Implementation
- ✅ Basic AlphaZero MCTS implementation
- ✅ TensorFlow policy-value network
- ✅ Self-play data generation
- ✅ Training loop with evaluation
- ✅ Ray-based parallel implementation

### Performance Benchmarks
Current performance (100 games, 10 simulations/move):
- Original implementation: 
  - 17.07 games/s (initial iteration)
  - 9-11 games/s (later iterations)
- Ray implementation:
  - 2 workers: 8.78 games/s (slower due to IPC overhead)
  - 8 workers: ~40 games/s
  - 16 workers: ~43 games/s (diminishing returns)

## Next Steps

### Performance Optimization
1. Reduce Ray overhead:
   - Investigate batch processing of games per worker
   - Consider in-memory model sharing instead of file-based
   - Profile serialization/deserialization costs
   - Optimize worker initialization

2. MCTS Optimization:
   - Profile MCTS simulation bottlenecks
   - Consider batching neural network predictions
   - Investigate value caching strategies

### Feature Additions
1. Training Improvements:
   - Add proper MCTS policy targets (currently using one-hot)
   - Implement proper temperature scheduling
   - Add support for training history

2. Monitoring & Analysis:
   - Add TensorBoard logging
   - Track MCTS statistics
   - Visualize game trees

### Code Quality
1. Testing:
   - Add unit tests for Ray implementation
   - Add performance regression tests
   - Test different game environments

2. Documentation:
   - Add detailed API documentation
   - Document performance characteristics
   - Add tuning guidelines

## Known Issues
1. Ray implementation requires 8+ workers to be effective due to IPC overhead
2. CUDA warnings in Ray workers (not affecting functionality)
3. Shared memory warnings in Docker environment

## Questions to Resolve
1. Why does the original implementation slow down in later iterations?
2. Can we reduce the Ray overhead for better small-scale performance?
3. What is the optimal batch size per worker?
