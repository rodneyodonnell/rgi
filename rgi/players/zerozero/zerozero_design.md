# Design Document: ZeroZero - A Generalized Game Playing AI Algorithm

## 0. Introduction

### 0.1. Author and Context

This design document was created by an AI assistant to assist in developing the ZeroZero algorithm for the RGI game-playing AI project. ZeroZero is an extension and generalization of the MuZero algorithm, aimed at creating a more flexible and powerful game-playing AI capable of learning and performing well across multiple games.

Instructions Summary:

- Develop a generalized MuZero-like algorithm capable of learning and playing multiple games.
- Break down the implementation plan into detailed, manageable tasks suitable for delegation.
- Include code snippets and examples, especially in Section 7, to clarify the tasks.
- Use markdown format for the document to facilitate easy saving and sharing.
- Include a "Section 0" summarizing the author and instructions for future updates.
- Provide examples of defining a Player class and demonstrate how action and state embeddings interact, including the dot product and softmax (two-tower model approach).

### 0.2. ZeroZero: An Extension of MuZero

ZeroZero builds upon the foundations laid by MuZero, extending and generalizing its approach in several key ways:

1. Multi-game learning: ZeroZero is designed to learn and play multiple games using a shared architecture, enabling transfer learning between different game domains.

2. Flexible state and action representations: Unlike MuZero, which typically uses game-specific representations, ZeroZero aims to handle arbitrary JSON representations for both states and actions, making it more adaptable to various game types.

3. Enhanced embedding models: ZeroZero incorporates more advanced embedding techniques, potentially using transformers or other architectures to better capture the structure of diverse game states and actions.

4. Improved MCTS integration: The algorithm includes optimizations and enhancements to the Monte Carlo Tree Search process, making it more efficient and effective across different game types.

5. Transfer learning focus: ZeroZero places a stronger emphasis on leveraging knowledge across games, potentially leading to faster learning and better generalization.

These extensions aim to create a more versatile and powerful game-playing AI system that can adapt to a wide range of games and potentially even non-game decision-making scenarios.

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design of the ZeroZero algorithm, a generalized game-playing AI capable of learning and performing well across multiple games. The approach focuses on embedding states and actions into a shared space and integrating these embeddings with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for reinforcement learning.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

### 2.1. Primary Goals

- Develop a generalized model that can learn to play multiple games using a shared architecture.
- Implement state and action embedding models that can handle arbitrary JSON representations.
- Integrate the learned models with MCTS to enhance decision-making.
- Validate the approach using Connect4 before generalizing to other games.
- Explore transfer learning to leverage knowledge across different games.

### 2.2. Secondary Goals

- Experiment with different model architectures (e.g., CNNs, Transformers).
- Optimize embedding dimensions and other hyperparameters.
- Implement efficient training techniques inspired by "EfficientZero" and "MuZero Unplugged."

## 3. Algorithm Overview

Generalized MuZero combines model-based reinforcement learning with MCTS. The algorithm learns:

- State Embedding Model: Converts game states (JSON blobs) into fixed-dimensional embeddings.
- Action Embedding Model: Converts actions into embeddings within the same space.
- Dynamics Model: Predicts the next state embedding given the current state embedding and an action embedding.
- Reward Model: Predicts the scalar reward for a given state embedding.
- Policy Model: Suggests the next action embedding based on the current state embedding.

These components enable planning through MCTS by simulating future states and rewards.

## 4. Model Architecture

### 4.1. State and Action Embeddings

- Shared Embedding Space: Both states and actions are embedded into a shared or closely related space to facilitate interaction.
- Embedding Models:
  - Initial Prototype: Use CNNs for games like Connect4 where states can be represented as grids.
  - Generalized Model: Transition to Transformers to handle arbitrary JSON representations for states and actions.
- Embedding Dimension: Configurable parameter (e.g., 64 dimensions) to be optimized through experimentation.

### 4.2. Dynamics and Reward Models

- Dynamics Model: Predicts the next state embedding given the current state and action embeddings.
- Reward Model: Outputs a scalar reward prediction for the current state embedding.
- Model Architecture: May consist of feedforward layers or more complex architectures depending on experimentation.

### 4.3. Policy Model

- Predicts the probabilities of legal actions given the current state embedding.
- Helps guide the MCTS by providing prior probabilities for actions.

## 5. Training Process

### 5.1. Data Generation

- Self-Play: Generate training data by having the AI play games against itself using a mostly random policy initially.
- Dataset Composition: Each training sample includes:
  - State embedding
  - Action taken
  - Resulting state embedding
  - Reward received
- Experience Replay: Store gameplay experiences for training and updating the models.

### 5.2. Training Methodology

- Loss Functions:
  - Dynamics Loss: Cosine similarity between predicted and actual next state embeddings.
  - Reward Loss: Mean squared error between predicted and actual rewards.
  - Policy Loss: Cross-entropy loss between predicted and actual actions taken.
- Optimization: Use techniques like stochastic gradient descent or Adam optimizer.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust embedding dimensions, learning rates, and other parameters.

## 6. Integration with MCTS

- MCTS Overview: Uses simulations to evaluate the potential outcomes of actions.
- Integration Strategy:
  - Use the policy model to provide prior probabilities for action selection in the tree.
  - Use the dynamics and reward models to simulate future states and rewards without actual gameplay.
- Efficient Implementation: Incorporate techniques from "EfficientZero" to reduce computational requirements.
